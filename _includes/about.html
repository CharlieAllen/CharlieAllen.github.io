                <div class="about_me">
                  <p>After working for nearly a decade in administrative roles, I realised that I needed a greater challenge and so enrolled at General Assembly on their 12-week 'Web Development Immersive' bootcamp to learn to code.</p>
                  <p>During the 12 weeks of the course, we covered:
                  <ul>
                    <li>HMTL and CSS, including frameworks such as Foundation and Bootstrap.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS.</li>
                    <li>Ruby, Rails, Sinatra.</li>
                    <li>SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.</li>
                    <li>Agile practices, TDD and GIT.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                  <p>I'm thrilled to now be part of such an inspiring place as London's tech community with its diverse and plentiful opportunities for learning and development, and equally excited to be looking for my first role as a Junior Web Developer.</p><p>When I'm not learning or coding, I can often be found either at The Castle in North London trying to climb up walls, or at Aerial Yoga in Whitechapel, hanging around upside down and trying to master handstands.</p>

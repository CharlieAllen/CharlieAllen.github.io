              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>After working for nearly a decade in the admin sector I realised I needed a greater challenge and so enrolled at General Assembly on their 12-week 'Web Development Immersive' bootcamp to learn to code.</p>
                <p>The Jekyll version is brought to you by <a href="https://github.com/swcool">Shane Weng</a></p>
                <p>This theme features stock photos by <a href="http://join.deathtothestockphoto.com//">Death to the Stock Photo</a>.</p>
                <p>Landing-Page includes full HTML, CSS, and custom JavaScript files along with LESS files for easy customization.</p>

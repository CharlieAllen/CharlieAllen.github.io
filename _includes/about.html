                <div class="about_me">
                  <p>After working for nearly a decade in administrative roles, I realised that I needed a greater challenge and so enrolled at General Assembly on their 12-week 'Web Development Immersive' bootcamp to learn to code.</p>
                  <p>During the 12 weeks of the course, we covered:
                  <ul>
                    <li>HMTL and CSS.</li>
                    <li>Javascript, Jquery, AngularJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS.</li>
                    <li>Ruby, Rails, Sinatra.</li>
                    <li>SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.</li>
                    <li>Agile practices, TDD, Git version control.</li>
                  </ul></p>
                  <p>I'm now looking for my first role as a Junior Web Developer, and very excited to be doing so.  The tech community is a great place to be as there is always something new to learn.</p>

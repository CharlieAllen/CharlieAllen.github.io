              <p>I am a coach and co-organiser with RailsGirls in London. I am very privileged to be a part of something which offers women the opportunity to try coding and hopefully inspires them to to move into this field. As my first role as a developer was found via RailsGirls, I love being able to "give back" to the community. I have also recently started coaching with the central London chapter of Codebar. </p> <br><hr>
